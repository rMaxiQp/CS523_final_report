\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we argue the importance of reliability on AIOps to achieve its practical use. In addition, we present a lightweight implementation on top of AIOpsLab to add another evaluation to the agents under the test. We are able to cover all 86 Kubernetes-related problems with less than 300 lines of code changes. With the listed case studies, we demonstrate our current solution is able to achieve safer cluster with minimal hand-holding on agents' behaviors.
