AI for IT operations (AIOps) aims to automate complex operational tasks, such as fault mitigation, to reduce human workload and minimize customer impact. With the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), the field starts to rely on LLMs output to leverage the decision making. However, LLMs are black boxes, that can generate destructive operations. 
This paper presents a lightweight safety guardrail embedded in the benchmark to disable destructive operations while measuring agents' reliability.
